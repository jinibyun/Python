all things for project and app should be setup (settings.py, urls.py ...) in advance.


1. views.py
	1. to see how it is changed.
		views.py > from django.views.generic import View
		
		urls.py > as_view()
	
		we need class CBView(View):
		
	2. compare function based view and class base view
	
	3. then, templateview
		IndexView section
	
	    urls.py > as_view()
